## Overlap
I changed the order of the layout between the photo and the chart as the last one contains information related to the tools and it was not visible.

## Lines 
The division lines were not visible enough, I made them a bit more pronounced.

## Detail changes
- I kept a single dark purple as font and background color.
- In general, I added more shadow and made edges rounder on the cards and photos.
- For some of the logos I used different ones.
- I did not include the dot pattern of the credit card and the the dashed connection lines.
